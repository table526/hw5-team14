Question: What regulates the production of neprilysin?
Correct Answer: somatostatin
F 1.8151188        In addition to their ability to phagocyte ??-amyloid, microglia can also clear A?? by degradation through the production of A??-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39].

Question: What substance exhibited a similar effect on  IDE secretion as achieved by somatostatin?
Correct Answer: octreotide
F 1.810153        This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
F 1.6796799        Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells.
F 1.3789771        g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
F 1.1365073        Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with ??-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates.
F 0.8266967        Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
T 0.7702451        Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.
F 0.7702451        It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20].
F 0.76055944        In this work, we show that in activated microglia, somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and proteolytic activity toward A??, which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A?? deposition.
F 0.74596673        Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A?? catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments.
T 0.7420192        As a whole, these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and, potentially, by analogue octreotide, in preventing A?? accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity.

Question: What method was used to inhibit the expression of IDE?
Correct Answer: siRNA
F 1.9897463        This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
F 1.9897463        Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
F 1.9897463        To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
F 1.865757        Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
F 1.8460627        IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
F 1.770546        Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
F 1.7417675        Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).
F 1.7417675        It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of ??-amyloid in the brain.
F 1.7417675        Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples indicates that no detectable effect of IDE expression is observed (left panel).
