Question: Which technique was used to determine the cellular locations of the CLU1 and CLU2 gene products?
Correct Answer: immunofluorescence experiments
F 0.17989147        Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio.
F 0.17989147        The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.
F 0.17146483        The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded.
F 0.17146483        Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
F 0.16347201        Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.
F 0.15699518        Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000.
F 0.15699518        Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology.
F 0.1554732        The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2.
F 0.15351206        However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000.
F 0.15351206        Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro.

Question: What compartments inside the cell contain clusterin proteins?
Correct Answer: ER and the Golgi apparatus
F 3.1744194        Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein.
F 2.9803903        Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A).
F 2.6078415        g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody.
F 2.1449182        CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
F 2.0323513        Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
F 2.0323513        Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
F 1.7360947        We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34].
F 1.5109608        Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A??) chaperone to alter A?? aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]).
F 1.4961216        Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).
F 1.4961216        Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.

F 0.60360056        Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].

Question: Which entity does allosterically regulate insulin degrading enzyme activity?
Correct Answer: somatostatin
F 0.51995146        It is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and ??-amyloid [8], [38].
F 0.22978824        Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8].
F 0.22747877        Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A??, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy.

F 0.40165257        IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
F 0.40165257        The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A?? levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration.
