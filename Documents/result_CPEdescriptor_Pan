1.0452415	Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human ?-secretase components.

Question: When APH1 genes are overexpressed in MEF KO what happens with the A???
2.582611	When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A? species [24].
1.5043917	Indeed, ?-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2.

Question: In which gene are mutations associated to many cases of early-onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease?G
1.7318636	The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000? g for 1 h at 4?C in a SW32
1.7318636	Editor: Stefano L. Sensi, University G. D'Annunzio, Italy
1.3854909	Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000? g for 20 min at 4?C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge.
1.3854909	The membranes were then incubated at 4?C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000? g at 4?C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved.
0.97969	Total protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000? g, 4?C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000? g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at ?80?C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).

Question: What experimental technique was used specifically to purify the ??-secretase complex?
1.7853162	3) Solubilisation of ?-secretase complexes.
1.481941	Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of ?-secretase complexes as described below.
1.481941	To do so, ?-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate.
1.3808159	(B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified ?-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants.
1.3808159	Another possible explanation would be that purified ?-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins.
1.3808159	Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively ?-secretase complexes made of human components.
1.3599014	A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified ?-secretase complexes.
1.3599014	PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the ?-secretase complex.
1.2796907	As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different ?-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses.
1.2587764	Note that the levels of A? produced from FAD-linked ?-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit.

0.23684373	Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue ?-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of ?-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.

0.6712094	In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active ?-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 ? and 12 ? resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29].

Question: What mutation of the PS1 protein causes ??-secretase activity almost to disappear?
1.0193384	Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of ?-secretase activity.
0.8564355	Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, ?E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of ?-secretase activity.
0.8006668	In vitro ?-secretase activity assays
0.72191924	In vitro ?-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27].
0.6935326	To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect ?-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity.
0.6679296	The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of ?-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A?1?40, A?1?42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.
0.6668361	The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting ?-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry.
0.61672366	Although a poor recovery of ?-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-?E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35].

Question: How many mutations relevant for familial forms of Alzheimer's disease have been detected for the PSEN1 gene?
0.8204544	Mutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1).
0.13342878	g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by ?-secretase have been reported.
0.13342878	This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.13342878	Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified ?-Secretase Complexes
0.11675018	Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong ?-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A?1?42/A?1?40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.11675018	Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) [1], [2], the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied, and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident.

0.026894707	It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A? species, mainly A?1?42, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16].
0.015368404	Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated ? - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ?E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).
