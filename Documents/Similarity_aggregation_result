Question: Which technique was used to determine the cellular locations of the CLU1 and CLU2 gene products?
Correct Answer: immunofluorescence experiments
F 0.06306015	Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio.
F 0.06306015	The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.
F 0.06014332	The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded.
F 0.06014332	Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
F 0.057284698	Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.
F 0.054902777	Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000.
F 0.054902777	Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology.
F 0.054416087	The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2.
F 0.053632103	However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000.
F 0.053632103	Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro.

Question: What compartments inside the cell contain clusterin proteins?
Correct Answer: ER and the Golgi apparatus
F 2.2579057	Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein.
F 2.1194148	Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A).
F 1.8544879	g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody.
F 1.3888146	CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
F 1.3888146	Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
F 1.3888146	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
F 1.1893243	We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34].
F 1.051252	Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A??) chaperone to alter A?? aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]).
F 1.024352	Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).
F 1.024352	Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.

Question: Which of the two CLU isoforms is the main one expressed in the choroid plexus?
Correct Answer: CLU2
F 1.4295757	Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.
F 1.274806	In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.
T 0.95010465	To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B).
T 0.917412	Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]).
F 0.35423023	Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].
F 0.31309825	Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs.
F 0.31309825	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
F 0.31309825	The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2???3 boundary.
F 0.31309825	Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.
F 0.31309825	One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35].

F 0.52452993	Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells.
F 0.44959712	These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques.
F 0.4238842	Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer???s disease.
F 0.4238842	The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure.
F 0.4238842	Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis.
F 0.4238842	Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression.

Question: When does oxidative stress happen in AD patients?
Correct Answer: before amyloid-beta accumulation
F 2.9756536	Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].
F 0.88976854	Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13].
F 0.88976854	Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD.
F 0.88976854	The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26].
T 0.88976854	One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28].
F 0.74757284	Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients.
F 0.6673264	Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD, and more recently, energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD [1???11].
T 0.5980583	Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression.
T 0.523301	Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells.
T 0.523301	There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4.

Question: How many mutations relevant for familial forms of Alzheimer's disease have been detected for the PSEN1 gene?
Correct Answer: 185
F 0.81963	Mutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1).
F 0.13308363	Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified ??-Secretase Complexes
F 0.13308363	g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by ??-secretase have been reported.
F 0.13308363	This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease.
F 0.116448164	Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) [1], [2], the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied, and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident.
