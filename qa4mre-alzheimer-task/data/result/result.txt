T 0.10365135	By looking at the blood or brains of patients we can get an idea of what goes wrong in Alzheimers disease and therefore design potential new treatments. From these studies we now know that a protein called A for an unknown reason builds up in the brain of Alzheimers patients, forming large clumps called plaques
T 0.10365135	Scientists can produce antibodies in the lab that bind to almost anything: a virus, a cancer cell or even the plaques we find in the brains of Alzheimers patients.
F 0.10365135	Inflammation in Alzheimers patients occurs around blood vessels in the brain causing damage and bleeding, potentially inducing further deterioration and memory loss.
F 0.10365135	If we could make this form of therapy safe for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, it would be a good step forward to reduce the suffering of millions of patients worldwide.
